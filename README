NAME
    MooseX::AttributeTags - tag your Moose attributes

SYNOPSIS
       package User;
   
       use Moose;
       use MooseX::Types::Moose 'Bool';
       use MooseX::AttributeTraits (
          SerializationStyle => [
             hidden => Bool,
          ],
       );
   
       has username => (
          traits => [ SerializationStyle ],
          is     => 'ro',
          hidden => 0,
       );
   
       has password => (
          traits => [ SerializationStyle ],
          is     => 'rw',
          hidden => 1,
       );

DESCRIPTION
    MooseX::AttributeTags is a factory for attribute traits. All the work is
    done in the import method.

  Methods
    `import(@optlist)`
        The option list is a list of trait names to create (which will be
        exported to the caller package as constants).

        Each trait name may be optionally followed by an arrayref of
        attributes to be created within the trait. (In the SYNOPSIS, the
        "SerializationStyle" trait gets an attribute called "hidden".)

        Each attribute may be optionally followed by *one* of:

        *   A coderef which provides a default value for the attribute.

        *   A type constraint object (such as those provided by
            Types::Standard or MooseX::Types; not a type constraint string) to
            validate the attribute.

        *   An arrayref or hashref providing options similar to those given to
            Moose's `has` keyword.
